# gloomyOS
Trying to make a vaguely Ubuntu ISO with tools and a pretty face. I apologize if your eyes burn after watching it.
Everything here is just test files, so if anything asks for a password, it's likely just "1212."
I should clarify that everything here is most likely just a poor imitation of something much better. I'm not looking to improve anything new, just to understand how things work so I can maybe do something productive someday. Welcome to my wall.
